NOTE: THIS THEME IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT. HERE ARE THE REMAINING TASKS:
 - Put up a demo version online (writer.bryanbraun.com)
 - Fix the reverse order nav menus (header and footer)
 - Fix code snippet settings for drupal 7
 - Optimize for perfection, out of the box
 - Test on IE
 - Make README a markdown document
 - Contribute to drupal.org
 - Tell everyone

The solution:
  Writer is a blogging theme For developers 

This theme was designed using three basic principles:
 - Brutally simple design
 - Fantasitic Typography
 - Support for code snippets

Why?

There are many great drupal developers who continue to use Garland or Bartik (the default Drupal themes) as the theme for their blog. These themes are fine but they were never designed to be used for a blog (not to mention that their overuse has made them tacky). Developers need a blogging theme that is stunningly simple and brings the reader's attention to the quality of their writings and their code.

Design Information:
 - Three-tone color Palette: #F7F7F7, #888888, #292929
 - Three Fantastic Fonts: 
   - Merriweather - slab serif (titles and body text), by Eben Sorkin
   - Lato - sans serif (header, footer, and dates), by Lukasz Dziedzic
   - Inconsolata - monospace (code snippets), by Raph Levien
 - The golden ratio (1:1.62) was used for font and line-height relationships

Other Features
 - Markup is HTML5
 - The design is responsive and scales nicely on all devices
 - The theme configuration settings allows you to choose between pre-built styles for how you want your code snippets to display

Code Snippet Instructions:
  To change the code format, change the setting at /admin/build/themes/settings/writer.
  You can use code snippets inline or in blocks. To refer to code inline, wrap the text in <code> tags. Example:

    <p>Use the <code>helloWorld()</code> function for testing.</p>

  To refer to code in a block, wrap the text in <pre> tags. Example:

    <p>Simply add this to the end of the file:</p>
    <pre>
    var result;
    if(myVar) {
      result = myFunction();
    } else {
      result = myOtherFunction();  
    }
    </pre>

Finally, this theme also makes it an excellent choice for authors, poets, or anyone else who has killer text-based content that can confidently stand on its own.
