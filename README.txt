NOTE: THIS THEME IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT. HERE ARE THE REMAINING TASKS:
- Port the theme over to Drupal 7
- Put up a demo version online (writer.bryanbraun.com)
- Test on IE
- Contribute to drupal.org
- Tell everyone

The problem:
  There are many great drupal developers who continue to use Garland or Bartik (the default Drupal themes) as the theme for their blog. These themes are fine but they were never designed to be used for a blog (not to mention that their overuse has made them tacky). Developers need a blogging theme that is stunningly simple and brings the reader's attention to the quality of their writings and their code.

The solution:
  Writer - A Blogging Theme For Developers 

This theme was designed using three basic principles:
 - Brutally simple design
 - Fantasitic Typography
 - Support for code snippets

Design Information:
 - Three-tone color Palette: #F7F7F7, #888888, #292929
 - Three Fantastic Fonts: 
   - Merriweather - slab serif (titles and body text), by Eben Sorkin
   - Lato - sans serif (header, footer, and dates), by Lukasz Dziedzic
   - Inconsolata - monospace (code snippets), by Raph Levien
 - Use the golden ratio (1:1.62), for font and line-height relationships
 - The design scales nicely on all devices
 - The theme configuration options allows you to choose between styles for how you want your code snippets to display

Writer is intentionally simple. There are only two regions: content-top, and footer. If you see value in adding more, I'd be happy to get your feedback.

Code Snippet Instructions:

  You can use code snippets inline or in blocks. To refer to code inline, wrap the text in <code> tags. Example:

    <p>Use the <code>helloWorld()</code> function for testing.</p>

  To refer to code in a block, wrap the text in <pre> tags. Example:

    <p>Simply add this to the end of the file:</p>
    <pre>
    var result;
    if(myVar) {
      result = myFunction();
    } else {
      result = myOtherFunction();  
    }
    </pre>

The simplicity of this theme also makes it an excellent choice for authors, poets, or anyone else who has killer text-based content that can confidently stand on its own.
