[ NOTE: THIS THEME IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND DOESN'T CURRENTLY WORK ]

The problem:
  There are many great drupal developers who continue to use Garland or Bartik (the default Drupal themes) as the theme for their blog. These themes are fine but they were never designed to be used for a blog (not to mention that their overuse has made them tacky). Developers need a blogging theme that is stunningly simple and brings the readers attention to the quality of their writings and their code.

The solution:
  Writer - A Blogging Theme For Developers 

This theme was designed using three basic principles:
 - Brutally simple design
 - Fantasitic Typography
 - Support for code snippets

Design Information:
 - Three-tone color Palette: #F7F7F7, #888888, #292929
 - Fantastic Fonts: Merriweather (titles and body text), Lato (header, footer, and dates), and Inconsolata (code snippets).
 - Deeply incorporates the golden ratio (1:1.62), especially with font and line-height relationships
 - The design scales nicely on all devices
 - The theme configuration options allows you to choose between styles for how you want your code snippets to display
 - To keep things simple, this theme focuses on CSS and uses no javascript

Writer is intentionally simple. There are only three regions: header, content, and footer.

Code Snippet Instructions:

  You can use code snippets inline or in blocks. To refer to code inline, wrap the text in <code> tags. Example:

    <p>The great thing about <code>helloWorld()</code> is that it accepts any number of parameters...</p>

  To refer to code in a block, wrap the text in <pre> tags. Example:

    <p>Simply add this to the end of the file:</p>
    <pre>
    var result;
    if(myVar) {
      result = myFunction();
    } else {
      result = myOtherFunction();  
    }
    </pre>

The simplicity of this theme also makes it an excellent choice for authors, poets, or anyone else who has killer text-based content that can confidently stand on its own.
