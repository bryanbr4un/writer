This theme was designed using three basic principles:
 - Brutally simple design
 - Fantasitic Typography
 - Support for code snippets

Design Information:
 - Three-tone color Palette: #F7F7F7, #888888, #292929
 - Three Fantastic Fonts:
   - Merriweather - slab serif (titles and body text), by Eben Sorkin
   - Lato - sans serif (header, footer, and dates), by Lukasz Dziedzic
   - Inconsolata - monospace (code snippets), by Raph Levien
 - The golden ratio (1:1.62) was used for font and line-height relationships

Other Features
 - Markup is HTML5
 - The design is responsive and scales nicely on all devices
 - Use theme settings to choose pre-built styles for your code snippets

Code Snippet Instructions:
 - Choose a snippet style via the setting at /admin/appearance/settings/writer
 - You can use code snippets inline or in blocks
 - To refer to code inline, wrap the text in <code> tags. Example:

  Use the <code>helloWorld()</code> function for testing.

 - To refer to code in a block, wrap the text in "<pre>" tags. Example:

  <p>Simply add this to the end of the file:</p>
  <pre>
  var result;
  if(myVar) {
    result = myFunction();
  } else {
    result = myOtherFunction();
  }
  </pre>
