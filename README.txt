This theme was designed using three basic principles:
 - Brutally simple design
 - Fantasitic Typography
 - Support for code snippets

Design Information:
 - Three-tone color Palette: #F7F7F7, #888888, #292929
 - Three Fantastic Fonts: 
   - Merriweather - slab serif (titles and body text), by Eben Sorkin
   - Lato - sans serif (header, footer, and dates), by Lukasz Dziedzic
   - Inconsolata - monospace (code snippets), by Raph Levien
 - The golden ratio (1:1.62) was used for font and line-height relationships

Other Features
 - Markup is HTML5
 - The design is responsive and scales nicely on all devices
 - The theme configuration settings allows you to choose between pre-built styles for how you want your code snippets to display

Code Snippet Instructions:
 - To change the code format, change the setting at /admin/build/themes/settings/writer.
 - You can use code snippets inline or in blocks. To refer to code inline, wrap the text in <code> tags. Example:

  Use the <code>helloWorld()</code> function for testing.

  To refer to code in a block, wrap the text in "<pre>" tags. Example:

    <p>Simply add this to the end of the file:</p>
    <pre>
    var result;
    if(myVar) {
      result = myFunction();
    } else {
      result = myOtherFunction();  
    }
    </pre>
